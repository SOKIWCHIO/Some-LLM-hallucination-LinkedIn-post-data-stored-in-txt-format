A few words on LLM hallucinations 

After last week’s AI-generated book list (with several non-existent titles), I figured it’s worth digging in a bit more.

It’s not that LLMs randomly mess up. It’s that they’re built to sound right, not be right. They generate what looks plausible based on the patterns they’ve seen, without fact-checking. 

That’s fine for brainstorming. Dangerous when you hit publish without looking twice.

So if you’re using LLMs to write, especially anything public, don’t just copy-paste and hope for the best.

Seen any great (or terrible) hallucinations lately? Drop them below.

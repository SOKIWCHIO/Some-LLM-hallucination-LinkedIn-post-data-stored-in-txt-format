Finally a tool to manage LLM hallucinations!

A single accuracy score for your LLM is b*shit (pardon my French ðŸ™ƒ)

"Our model is 90% accurate." What does that even mean? Does it mean it's 90% right on easy questions and 0% right on hard ones? Or that it gets 90% of every answer partially right? A single number hides the truth.

To build trustworthy AI, we need to understand theÂ full spectrumÂ of its behavior, not just one vanity metric. We need to know the trade-offs.

My open-source evaluator replaces the single, misleading accuracy score with aÂ Risk-Coverage Curve. This is the honest report card for your LLM.

The curve instantly answers the critical business questions that a single number can't: Which is the best tradeoff for my particular use case?

Stop making critical product decisions based on a single, incomplete number. Start making informed, data-driven trade-offs.

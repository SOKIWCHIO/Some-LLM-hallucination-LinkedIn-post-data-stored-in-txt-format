32+ ways to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). 

This research paper talks about multiple ways to reduce AI hallucinations like:

1. Real-Time Hallucination Detection and Correction: Techniques like the EVER framework are revolutionizing the way LLMs operate by detecting and rectifying hallucinations during the generation process, thereby preventing the accumulation of errors.

2. Post-Generation Refinement: Approaches such as Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision (RARR) and High Entropy Word Spotting are pivotal in aligning AI-generated content with accurate information post-generation.

3. Self-Reflection and Structured Reasoning: New strategies like ChatProtect and Structured Comparative reasoning employ self-reflection methodologies and structured approaches, ensuring consistency and reducing hallucinations in specialized tasks.

4. Prompt Tuning and End-to-End Training: Techniques like UPRISE and SynTra demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt tuning and end-to-end training in enhancing the truthfulness and relevance of AI-generated content.

5. Decoding Strategies and Knowledge Graph Utilization: Novel decoding strategies and the use of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are proving to be effective in guiding AI towards more authentic and context-specific generation.

6. Supervised Fine-Tuning and Behavioral Approaches: Methods like Knowledge Injection and HAR leverage supervised fine-tuning and behavioral approaches, significantly improving the factuality of LLMs.

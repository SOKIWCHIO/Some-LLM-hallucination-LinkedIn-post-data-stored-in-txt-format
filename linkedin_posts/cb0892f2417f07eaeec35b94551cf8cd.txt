We detect hallucinations before the LLM knows its hallucinating. 

Rooted in our new paper on how LLMs achieve Bayesian learning in expectation https://lnkd.in/e6ie5ZNz, 

The Discovery: Using Minimum Description Length (MDL) analysis on OpenAI's davinci-002, we found that hallucinations occur when models encounter "incompressible" prompts - text that's too complex or volatile to efficiently encode.

Key Findings:
📊 The Compensation Effect: When prompt complexity (MDL) is high, models generate simpler outputs to compensate. Think of it like a pressure release valve.

📈 Volatility Triggers Hallucinations: Alternating between simple/complex tokens confuses models more than consistent complexity.

🛠️ We Can Prevent It: By "pre-decompressing" complex prompts with context or gradual introduction, we improved success rates from 40% to 80%!

Pre-decompression works by:
 - Contextualizing - Give the model a framework to understand nonsense
 - Gradualizing - Don't hit the model with full complexity at once
 - Meta-acknowledging - Let the model know it's okay to struggle
 - Pattern-building - Create low-MDL anchors before high-MDL content

Real Impact:
Prompt engineering: Add context before complexity
AI Safety: Predict hallucinations before they happen
Model training: Design better data curation strategies
The most surprising finding? Being honest with AI about difficulty ("this looks like gibberish") works better than trying to hide complexity.

This opens new doors for making AI more reliable through information theory rather than just scaling up.

Big thanks to Mark Antonio Moustapha Awada Ph.D. for the theoretical work.
Thank you to Zein Khamis and Sarah Rashidi for their hard work on the code and empirical findings.

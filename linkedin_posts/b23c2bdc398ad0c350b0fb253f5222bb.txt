Very interesting paper on LLM hallucinations, with an ability to detect confabulations that are due to a lack of knowledge. "The success of semantic entropy at detecting errors suggests that LLMs are even better at “knowing what they don’t know” [...] - they just don’t know they know what they don’t know. "

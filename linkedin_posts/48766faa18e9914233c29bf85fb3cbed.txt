Reduce LLM hallucinations with RAG over textual as well as structured knowledge bases. Today we are releasing WSTaRK h, a large-scale LLM retrieval benchmark on semi-structured knowledge bases with dataset from e-commerce, biomedicine, and academic research.

LLMs excel at reasoning and semantic retrieval, they struggle with more complex tasks. Especially when real-world user queries require a combination of unstructured (text) and structured (relational) knowledge. How do we track the capability of LLM-driven systems in handling such tasks?

STaRK features large-scale knowledge bases with natural-sounding, diverse, and useful queries, which involves a blend unstructured and structured information. Moreover, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate the ground truth answers.

STaRK presents significant opportunities by offering a comprehensive retrieval testbed on product recommendations, academic paper searches, and precision medicine inquiries. 

With STaRK, we found that current LLM retrieval systems CANNOT accurately retrieve information. More powerful systems are needed!

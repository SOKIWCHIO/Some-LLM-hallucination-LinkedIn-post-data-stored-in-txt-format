𝐃𝐢𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐋𝐋𝐌 𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞?

In a recent post, I talked about why hallucinations happen in LLMs and how they affect different AI applications. While creative fields may welcome hallucinations as a way to spark out-of-the-box thinking, business use cases don’t have that flexibility. In industries like healthcare, finance, or customer support, hallucinations can’t be overlooked. Accuracy is non-negotiable, and catching unreliable LLM outputs in real-time becomes essential.
So, here’s the big question: 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱 𝐚𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬?

That’s where the 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐲 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 (𝐓𝐋𝐌) steps in. TLM helps you detect LLM errors/hallucinations by scoring the trustworthiness of every response generated by 𝐚𝐧𝐲 LLM.  This comprehensive trustworthiness score combines factors like data-related and model-related uncertainties, giving you an automated system to ensure reliable AI applications.

🏁 The benchmarks are impressive. TLM reduces the rate of incorrect answers from OpenAI’s o1-preview model by up to 20%. For GPT-4o, that reduction goes up to 27%. On Claude 3.5 Sonnet, TLM achieves a similar 20% improvement.

Here’s how TLM changes the game for LLM reliability:
1️⃣ For Chat, Q&A, and RAG applications: displaying trustworthiness scores helps your users identify which responses are unreliable, so they don’t lose faith in the AI.
2️⃣ For data processing applications (extraction, annotation, …): trustworthiness scores help your team identify and review edge-cases that the LLM may have processed incorrectly.
3️⃣ The TLM system can also select the most trustworthy response from multiple generated candidates, automatically improving the accuracy of responses from any LLM.

With tools like TLM, companies can finally productionize AI systems for customer service, HR, finance, insurance, legal, medicine, and other high-stakes use cases.  Kudos to the Cleanlab team for their pioneering research to advance the reliability of AI.

I am sure you want to learn more and use it yourself, so I will add reading materials in the comments!

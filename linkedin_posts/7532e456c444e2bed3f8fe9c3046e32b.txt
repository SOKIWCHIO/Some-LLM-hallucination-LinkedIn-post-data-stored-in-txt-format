💥 💥 💥 Folks I am excited to share I have joined Galileo to contribute on data centric ML for all applications - LLM, NLP & CV.

Having worked in the industry for a while I strongly believe great data unlocks great capabilities in a model. Galileo works exclusively on this and has solutions for varied NLP and CV tasks.

And, I have a great news for 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐀𝐈 builders 👾 ...

We are working on 𝐋𝐋𝐌 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨 which will help 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐀𝐈 builders take control of building LLM applications by helping them:
- optimise prompts 
- compare model performance 
- detect hallucinations
- debug training data
- monitor LLMs

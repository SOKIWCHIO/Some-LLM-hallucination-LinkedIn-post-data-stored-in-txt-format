Don't chase the perfect LLM! Instead learn how to build great products with the ones we have.

Lots of buzz lately around LLM hallucinations and reproducibility. And I really enjoy reading papers like the one from OpenAI (Why LLMs hallucinate) and Mira Murati's post on how to make LLMs more reliable.

But soon I will have to teach a class at è‹±å›½ä¼¦æ•¦å•†å­¦é™¢ about how to build GenAI products in the real world - and that means building products with a technology that is potentially unreliable.

The good news is that this unreliability can be measured and managed. And that it is still valuable and advisable to build products with this technology - when appropriate.

One such way to measure and manage LLM hallucinations is Google Cloud's recent work won Gemhall - a framework that lets developers evaluate a model's hallucinations by instructing it to abstain from answering unless its confidence is above a given threshold.

It's been a while since I've posted anything on LinkedIn! Today, I'd like to share some work by my son, Sebastian Farquhar, a research scientist at Google DeepMind. His recent paper describes a new algorithm to determine if an LLM is hallucinating (under certain conditions) has just come out in Nature. You can find it here: https://lnkd.in/ekYuibv2

Additionally, there's a very accessible article on Sebastian's work in Time Magazine. Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/ehrBkru9 

I'm excited about this work because it could make a practical difference in an area that has been vexing hundreds of millions of people, it has a solid formal foundation, and it is also easy to understand.

The best part of Apple letting me go over a door I left open (seriously lol) was the freedom to publish anything I want. 

Imagine proving that LLM hallucinations can be detected before the LLM even hallucinated. Imagine solving this problem via prompt-based efficient decompression. Imagine discovering prompt restructuring was all you needed to one shot efficient code development on basic foundation models.

Now imagine not being able to release that for free.

Imagine some product manager chugging matcha while taking credit for the findings in front of a board whilst they decide how much to charge people for it.

6 months later as I‚Äôm publishing these methods and tools all I can say is alhamdulilah. Don‚Äôt be sad if you ever got let go from somewhere. There‚Äôs way better potentially waiting on the other side.

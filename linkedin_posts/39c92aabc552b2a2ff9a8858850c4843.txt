Exciting news! 🎉 Large Language Models (LLMs) have been game-changers across various domains, yet there's a persistent challenge: hallucinations. While LLMs can generate impressive outputs, they sometimes produce responses that are factually incorrect or completely made up, limiting their adoption in critical use cases.

One key step toward solving this problem is **detecting** these hallucinations. Over the past few years, the research community has proposed a multitude of algorithms to tackle this issue. But we still need better tools to evaluate and compare their effectiveness.

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce **PolygraphLLM**, an open-source Python library and interactive dashboard designed to empower AI practitioners and researchers. 🚀 With PolygraphLLM, you can test, evaluate, and benchmark different approaches for hallucination detection, helping you build more reliable and effective LLM-powered applications.

We've already implemented many state-of-the-art algorithms, and we're continually expanding the toolkit with new features and approaches. Researchers and developers, we’d love for you to join us on this journey! Whether you're improving existing methods or contributing your own, your input is welcome. 🤝

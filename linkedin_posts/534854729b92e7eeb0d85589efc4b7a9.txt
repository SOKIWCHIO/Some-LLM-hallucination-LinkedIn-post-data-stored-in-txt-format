I've been experimenting and playing around with Pydantic for some time. 
I think it's a great validation library in Python and the core validation logic implemented in Rust certainly addresses some of the concerns with memory safety for implementations in C/C++. 

The blog below certainly highlights the benefits of using Pydantic for prompt validation. This is certainly a direction towards type safety in AI systems.
